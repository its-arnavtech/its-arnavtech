# Hi there, I'm Arnav! üëã

Welcome to my GitHub profile!
Here's a little bit about me:

I'm Arnav, a rising sophmore at UT Dallas, Graduating May 2028.
My main interests are in Data Science and Machine Learning. My most valuable experiences in this field were when I worked on a project from a club at UT Dallas called IEEE, wherein I was tasked to create an image classifier using a pre-trained model. This tool classified pictures of animals such as dogs and cats and classified them with labels such as a specific breed of the animal and it's origins, and so on, using several different labels.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Tools
- Programming Languages: **Python, JavaScript, C/C++, HTML/CSS**
- Frameworks: **React**
- Databases: **MySQL, Google BigQuery, PostgreSQL**
- Tools: **Git, VS Code, CLion**

That's a little bit about my experience. I'm always eager to connect, so don't hesitate to send a connect/follow request. Have a good day!
